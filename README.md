# Hand Controller

The **Hand Controller** project enables touchless control of your computer using hand gestures. Move the cursor with your index finger and perform click operations by tapping your thumb and middle finger together. Built with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe, this project leverages real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition for an intuitive user experience. Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the script to start controlling your cursor with your hand!
